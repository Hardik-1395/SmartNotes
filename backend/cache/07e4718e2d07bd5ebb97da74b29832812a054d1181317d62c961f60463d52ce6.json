{"summary": "**Understanding Modules and Packages**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis tutorial explains the concepts of modules and packages in programming, highlighting their differences and providing a simple example of using modules.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n* **Modules**: A module is a single file that contains related functions, variables, and classes.\n* **Packages**: A package is a collection of related modules that organizes and structures code into a logical hierarchy.\n\n**Key Differences**\n\n* Modules are single files, while packages are collections of related modules.\n* Modules can be reused in different parts of a program, while packages provide a way to organize and structure code.\n\n**Using Modules**\n\nTo use a module:\n\n1. **Navigate to the module**: Locate the module in your file system.\n2. **Select the module**: Click on the module to view its contents.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\n* Imagine you have two versions of a module: `cjs` (CommonJS) and `esm` (ES Module). You can navigate to and select either module to use it in your program.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* A module is a single file with related code.\n* A package is a collection of related modules.\n* To use a module, navigate to and select it.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis tutorial provides a basic introduction to modules and packages in programming. Understanding the differences between these concepts is essential for organizing and structuring code in a logical and reusable way."}
