{"summary": "**Understanding V8 Engine and JavaScript Code**\n\n**What is V8 Engine?**\n\nThe V8 engine is a JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is used to execute JavaScript code in web browsers and Node.js environments.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n* **V8 Engine**: a JavaScript engine developed by Google.\n* **Raper**: a way to wrap JavaScript code around the V8 engine's JavaScript code.\n* **JavaScript Code**: code written in the JavaScript programming language.\n* **Abstraction**: a way to simplify complex concepts by providing a layer of simplicity.\n\n**Adding a Raper to V8 Engine**\n\nTo add a Raper, write JavaScript code that wraps around the V8 engine's code. This wrapping code is called a Raper. Adding a Raper makes it easier to work with the V8 engine's code.\n\n**Why Add a Raper?**\n\n* **Easier to Work with V8 Engine's Code**: A Raper provides a layer of abstraction between the V8 engine and the JavaScript code.\n* **Simplifies Complex Concepts**: A Raper makes it easier to work with the V8 engine's code by providing a simpler interface.\n\n**Example**\n\nImagine you want to change the color of a Raper. You would write JavaScript code to wrap around the V8 engine's code and change the color. This would make it easier to work with the V8 engine's code.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe V8 engine is a JavaScript engine developed by Google. A Raper is a way to wrap JavaScript code around the V8 engine's code, making it easier to work with the V8 engine's code. A Raper provides a layer of abstraction and simplifies complex concepts, making it a useful tool for working with the V8 engine."}
