{"summary": "**Understanding JavaScript's Limitations**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nJavaScript has limitations that restrict its use as a backend framework. This explanation will discuss the reasons behind these limitations.\n\n**JavaScript's Limitations**\n\n* **No Built-in Multithreading Support**: Unlike languages like Java or C++, JavaScript does not support multithreading, making it difficult to handle multiple requests concurrently.\n* **No File System Access**: JavaScript lacks direct access to the file system, preventing operations like file reading and writing.\n* **No Built-in Database Support**: JavaScript does not support database interactions, making it challenging to store and retrieve data.\n\n**Analogy: A Human Trying to Fly**\n\nImagine a person trying to fly by jumping off the ground. They lack the physical attributes (wings, muscles, etc.) to fly, just like JavaScript lacks the necessary functionality to handle backend tasks.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, JavaScript's limitations make it unsuitable for use as a backend framework. Its lack of functionality in areas like multithreading, file system operations, and database interactions restrict its ability to handle complex backend tasks."}
