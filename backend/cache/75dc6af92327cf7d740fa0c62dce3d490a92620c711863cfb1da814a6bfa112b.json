{"summary": "**Understanding JavaScript and V8 Engine**\n\n**Introduction to JavaScript as a Back-end Language**\n\nJavaScript is a versatile language used for both front-end and back-end development. However, it's not feasible to create a server-side application directly using JavaScript. To overcome this limitation, the V8 engine is used to create a server environment.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* JavaScript is used for both front-end and back-end development.\n* JavaScript cannot be used directly for server-side applications.\n* V8 engine is used to create a server environment to overcome this limitation.\n\n**V8 Engine and its Capabilities**\n\nThe V8 engine is a JavaScript engine written in C++. It has the capability to create a server environment, allowing us to create a server using JavaScript.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The V8 engine is a JavaScript engine written in C++.\n* It has the capability to create a server environment.\n* By using the V8 engine's capabilities, we can create a server using JavaScript.\n\n**Using JavaScript as a Back-end Language**\n\nWe use a JavaScript wrapper to utilize the V8 engine's capabilities, allowing us to create a server environment using JavaScript. The wrapper enables JavaScript to communicate with the C++ code of the V8 engine.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* We use a JavaScript wrapper to utilize the V8 engine's capabilities.\n* The wrapper enables JavaScript to communicate with the C++ code of the V8 engine.\n* This allows us to create a server environment using JavaScript.\n\n**Steps to Create a Server using JavaScript and V8 Engine**\n\nTo create a server using JavaScript and the V8 engine, follow these steps:\n\n* Use a JavaScript wrapper to create a server environment.\n* Utilize the V8 engine's capabilities to create a server.\n* Leverage the C++ code of the V8 engine to interact with the server environment.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy using the V8 engine and a JavaScript wrapper, we can create a server environment using JavaScript, even though JavaScript is not natively designed for back-end development. This allows us to leverage the capabilities of JavaScript in a server-side context."}
