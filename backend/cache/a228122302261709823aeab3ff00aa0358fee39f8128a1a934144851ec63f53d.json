{"summary": "**Introduction to JavaScript Code Handling**\n\nThis tutorial introduces the process of handling JavaScript code and converting it to C++ V8 code for server creation. The main goal is to create a server using the converted code.\n\n**Understanding the Process**\n\n* The JavaScript code will be handled and converted to C++ V8 code.\n* The converted code will be used to create a server.\n\n**Key Steps**\n\n* **JavaScript Code Handling**:\n + Processing of the JavaScript code.\n* **Conversion to C++ V8 Code**:\n + Conversion of the JavaScript code to C++ V8 code.\n* **Server Creation**:\n + Creation of a server using the converted C++ V8 code.\n\n**Concepts**\n\n* **JavaScript Code**: The code to be handled and converted.\n* **C++ V8 Code**: The converted code used to create a server.\n* **Server**: The final product created using the converted C++ V8 code.\n\n**Logic**\n\n* The JavaScript code is given to someone who writes a layer on top of it.\n* The layer converts the JavaScript code to C++ V8 code.\n* The converted C++ V8 code is given to another person who creates a server.\n\n**Example**\n\n* The process is compared to a three-party scenario:\n + Party 1 gives their code to Party 2.\n + Party 2 writes a layer on top of the code and gives it to Party 3.\n + Party 3 uses the code to create a server.\n\nIn summary, the process involves handling JavaScript code, converting it to C++ V8 code, and using the converted code to create a server. The converted code acts as a layer that enables server creation, highlighting the key steps and concepts involved in the process."}
