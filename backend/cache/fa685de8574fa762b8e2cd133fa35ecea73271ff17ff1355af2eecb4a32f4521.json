{"summary": "**Introduction to Node.js**\n\n**What is Node.js?**\n\nNode.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to create server-side applications. It enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side, allowing developers to create a server that can handle multiple requests simultaneously.\n\n**Key Features of Node.js**\n\n* **JavaScript Runtime Environment**: Node.js provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.\n* **Non-Blocking I/O**: Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model to create efficient and scalable server-side applications.\n* **Event-Driven**: Node.js uses an event-driven model for asynchronous programming.\n\n**How Node.js Works**\n\nNode.js works by creating a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code on the server-side. It uses a non-blocking, event-driven I/O model to enable efficient and scalable server-side applications.\n\n**Installing Node.js and npm**\n\nTo install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), follow these steps:\n\n* **Download and Install Node.js**: Download the Node.js installer from the official website and install it on your computer.\n* **Verify Installation**: Verify that Node.js is installed by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `node -v`.\n* **Verify npm**: Verify that npm is installed by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `npm -v`.\n\n**Understanding Node.js and npm**\n\nNode.js and npm are two separate components:\n\n* **Node.js**: Provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.\n* **npm**: A package manager that enables developers to install and manage dependencies for Node.js projects.\n\nBy understanding Node.js and npm, developers can create efficient and scalable server-side applications using JavaScript."}
